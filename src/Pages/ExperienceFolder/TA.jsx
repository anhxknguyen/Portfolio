                leading two groups of 12-15 students{" "}

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              I was also responsible for conducting a semester-long research
              project on how to improve on the effectiveness of the current
              workshop program. I worked alongside Sherry Zhao, a friend and
              fellow TA, to identify whether or not icebreaker activities
              increased student engagement (PS: it does by 15%!).

              Working as a workshop leader not only allowed me to continue to
              hone my programming and leadership skills, but it also allowed me
              to create valuable bonds with both my students and fellow TAs. I
              have had the honor of leading not one, but two groups of
              hard-working and passionate, aspiring programmers like myself and
              have had the priviledge of working with some of the most talented
              leaders/programmers I had ever met in my group of TAs, some of
              whom I now call friends. If anyone of you are reading this
              (whether you're a student or a fellow workshop TA), thank you for
              making my first real job so memorable!
